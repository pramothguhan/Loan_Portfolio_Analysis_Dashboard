## About this Project :memo:

### Introduction:
The loan portfolio is a crucial element in the financial sector, influencing economic activities and shaping the financial landscape. This project explores the factors that impact loan approvals, the relationship between creditworthiness and interest rates, and the historical performance of loans. By using Tableau, the project visualizes these dynamics, offering stakeholders a clear and actionable understanding of the financial environment.

### Data Description:
- **Source:** The dataset includes over 5.7 million loan applications and borrower profiles from LendingClub, covering the years 2007 to 2018.
- **Key Features:** Loan amounts, annual income, interest rates, loan status, purpose, credit score (FICO), borrower grades, and subgrades.
- **Total Loan Amount:** Over $750 million across 580,000 open accounts in the U.S.
- **Average Loan Amount:** Over $15,000 with an average interest rate of 13.08%.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data integrity by addressing inconsistencies and missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered patterns, relationships, and correlations within the dataset.
3. **Visualization:** Developed three distinct Tableau dashboards to capture different facets of loan analysisâ€”Loan Purpose Analysis, Loan Distribution Analysis, and Loan Grade Analysis.

### Design Process:
- **Visualization Types:** Carefully selected charts and graphs to effectively communicate key findings, including loan amounts, interest rates, and borrower demographics.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Implemented interactive elements in the dashboards, allowing users to dynamically explore the data.
- **Cohesive Design:** Utilized a consistent color scheme and layout for clarity and ease of interpretation.

### Key Insights:
- **Loan Purpose Analysis:**
  - Identified trends in average interest rates from 2006 to 2016, with notable fluctuations.
  - Highlighted the top loan purposes such as Debt Consolidation, Credit Card, and Home Improvement.
  - Analyzed loan amounts across different purposes and states.

- **Loan Distribution Analysis:**
  - Mapped the distribution of loan amounts across U.S. states from 2007 to 2018.
  - Analyzed loan statuses, with Fully Paid and Current loans being the most prevalent.
  - Examined loan issuance trends based on home ownership status and loan types.

- **Loan Grade Analysis:**
  - Compared loan terms, with 60-month terms being more common than 36-month terms.
  - Tracked the number of loans over time, comparing Fully Paid and Charged Off loans.
  - Explored loan distribution across grades, revealing variations in individual and joint applications.
